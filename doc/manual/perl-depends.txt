NAME
    perl-depends - Roughly find out module depends from perl file(s)

SYNOPSIS
      perl-depends [options] FILE [FILE ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Find out roughly the modules the program uses. This is based on the
    idea, that Perl evaluates the "use" commands at compile time and stored
    the loaded module information into the *%INC* variable. By examining the
    loaded modules and comparing them against the standard Perl modules, the
    extenal module dpendencies can be roughly estimated.

    The original files need to be instrumented for this to work and the
    modifications are stored in a temporary file.

    In order to see the depends, user must run the instrumented files. This
    is because, the program cannot know what possible options needs to
    passed to the program to trigger "no behavior", that is, something that
    doesn't actually run the program. Such options would be --version,
    --dry-run, --generate-syntax-error-now etc.

    An example of output: the external module depends here is
    'Regexp::Common' and the rest of them can be ignored.

        Regexp::Common                 Regexp/Common.pm
        Regexp::Common::CC             Regexp/Common/CC.pm
        ...

OPTIONS
    -e, --extension=EXT
        Use extension EXT for instrumented files. The defaul is ".tmp".

    -h, --help
        Print text help

    --help-exclude
        Print default exclude path value when --exclude-vcs is used.

    --help-html
        Print help in HTML format.

    --help-man
        Print help in manual page man(1) format.

    -v, --verbose LEVEL
        Print informational messages. Increase numeric LEVEL for more
        verbosity.

    -V, --version
        Print contact and version information.

EXAMPLES
    Intrument a file, run it to see results and delete instrumentation:

        perl-depends file.pl
