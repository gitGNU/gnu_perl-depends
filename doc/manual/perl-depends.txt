NAME
    perl-depends - Roughly find out module depends from perl file(s)

SYNOPSIS
      perl-depends [options] FILE [FILE ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Find out roughly the modules the program uses. This is based on the
    idea, that Perl evaluates the "use" commands at compile time and stores
    the loaded module information into the %INC variable. By examining the
    loaded modules and comparing them against the standard Perl modules, the
    extenal module dpendencies can be roughly estimated.

    The depends information can be used to determine what external modules
    have to be installed before program can be used.

    The file need to be instrumented for the depency checking. The rusulting
    "binary" is then stored in a temporary file which the user runs.

    To prgram does not run the instrumented files because it cannot know
    what possible options need to be passed to the program to trigger "no
    behavior". That is, something that doesn't actually run the program.
    Such options would include --version, --dry-run,
    --generate-syntax-error-now, invalid files etc. The user can know better
    the details of the inspected file.

    An example of output: the external module depends here is
    'Regexp::Common' and the rest of them can be ignored.

        Regexp::Common                 Regexp/Common.pm
        Regexp::Common::CC             Regexp/Common/CC.pm
        ...

OPTIONS
    -e, --extension=EXT
        Use extension EXT for instrumented files. The defaul is ".tmp".

    -h, --help
        Print text help

    --help-exclude
        Print default exclude path value when --exclude-vcs is used.

    --help-html
        Print help in HTML format.

    --help-man
        Print help in manual page man(1) format.

    -v, --verbose LEVEL
        Print informational messages. Increase numeric LEVEL for more
        verbosity.

    -V, --version
        Print contact and version information.

EXAMPLES
    Intrument a file, run it to see results and delete instrumentation:

        perl-depends file.pl
        perl file.pl.tmp --version
        rm *.tmp
