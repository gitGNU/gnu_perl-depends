NAME
    perl-depends - Roughly find out module depends from Perl file(s)

SYNOPSIS
      perl-depends [options] FILE [FILE ...]

DESCRIPTION
    Find out roughly the modules the program uses. This is based on the
    idea, that Perl evaluates the "use" commands at compile time and stores
    the loaded module information into the %INC variable. By examining the
    loaded modules and comparing them against the standard Perl modules, the
    external module dependencies can be roughly estimated.

    The depends information can be used to determine what external modules
    have to be installed before a program can be used.

    The target FILE have to be instrumented with the dependency checking
    code. The resulting "binary" is then stored in a temporary file which
    the user runs.

    This program does not run the instrumented files because it cannot know
    what possible options need to be passed for the program to trigger "no
    behavior". That is, something that doesn't actually involve executing
    the "binary" in real. Such options passed would include --version,
    --dry-run, invalid options like --generate-syntax-error-now, or invalid
    files etc. to make program stop on error. The user can know better the
    details of running the intrumented file.

    An example of output: the external module depends here is
    'Regexp::Common' and the rest of them can be ignored.

        Regexp::Common                 Regexp/Common.pm
        Regexp::Common::CC             Regexp/Common/CC.pm
        ...

OPTIONS
    -e, --extension=EXT
        Use extension EXT for instrumented files. The default is ".tmp".

    -h, --help
        Print text help

    --help-html
        Print help in HTML format.

    --help-man
        Print help in manual page man(1) format.

    -v, --verbose LEVEL
        Print informational messages. Increase numeric LEVEL for more
        verbosity.

    -V, --version
        Print contact and version information.

EXAMPLES
    Instrument a file, run it to see results and delete instrumentation:

        perl-depends file.pl
        perl file.pl.tmp --version
        rm *.tmp
